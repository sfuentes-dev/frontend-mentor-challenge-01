## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com//) - For styles

### What I learned

Improving and reinforcing my skills in React JS and TailwindCSS and also learning new libraries like validator to validate form elements in a faster and easier way without forgetting the basics of JavaScript.

### Continued development

Keep improving React in order to create much cleaner and high quality components.
